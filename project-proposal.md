#### MY IDEA: 
My data project will examine social media use by police departments, narrowing in on the content they promote and critiquing reach to citizens on social media by tracking their engagement and understanding nature of the service social media enables them to provide. 
I believe it is most useful to focus on San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties (though of course, if I have the time to do more of the state of California, I will do so).

#### THE REASON:
I’ve had an inkling about this idea for most of the quarter. It started when I reported on senior scams and learned about the police’s desire toward greater civic engagement to increase the quality of their police work. More source-building with local police had me realize that, around here in Silicon Valley, police departments are doing a lot in the way of social media in an attempt, again, to engage and connect with citizens in a meaningful way. 

I’ve always been curious, though, if social media use by the police is all it’s cracked up to be. Silicon Valley, geographically ad socially, persists as a glaring example of two distinct divides in its citizenship. First, the economic divide (the classic “haves and have-nots” concern, between the rich tech elite and the tough working class, within shared zip codes); and secondly, and perhaps more confusingly, the digital divide (between those who are attune to the innovation modern technology provides and who participate in the digital community, and those who are left behind, due to a lack of access to the digital sphere or an unfamiliarity with its sophistication).  

I have a hard time believing that these factors do not influence the way local citizens engage with social media, and in turn, the way police can engage with citizens through it… I have a hunch there is something in here. Perhaps social media is only catering to a certain type of citizen (rich, savvy, already plugged in), and maybe (and of course, unexpectedly) underserving others (the poor, the unplugged, those who are perhaps in the greatest need of police connection)? I don’t want to be too cynical here, as I think social media is obviously a good idea in general for police to boost engagement, but I worry that social media as a forum may work to exclude some areas of the public that may need the most help and attention in the first place. 

#### MY HYPOTHESIS:
My hypothesis would dictate that the people engaged in social media use are probably wealthy, connected, maybe even other officials (in law enforcement, government, and news), and perhaps cross-listed “followers” of multiple social media accounts put forth by that police department. I would also guess that these followers are older, probably middle-aged, or at the very least, adults over the age of 21. This hypothesis implies that that the followers who are not engaged with social media accounts of police are young, poor, non-connected, and not in the public eye. 
Also, I would guess that that the a significant of the content on these police department social media handles are “light” – that is, more for fun or for laughs than pure-and-simple crime updates and warnings. I would guess it is over 30% of their content. 
Additionally, I would assume that the level of engagement from followers increases with that “light” content, over the harder content. An example: I bet a picture of a police dog laying down in the back of a cop car gets, far and away, more “likes,” “retweets,” or “shares” (depending on the platform) than the warning of a criminal who just robbed a local supermarket.  

####MY “STARTER” DATA SOURCES:

First, and most importantly, I need to track police department content as it comes out. I know I can learn how to do this over Twitter, after we used some SQL data collected about Congressional tweeting. I want to learn how to run that program and programs like it to create at least 3 starting data sources, which should include the following subsets of information about them:
  - Twitter accounts of SMC and SCC police departments
      - Account name
      - Time of tweet 
      - Category (original tweet v. retweet)
      - Number of favorites, number of retweets on that particular tweet
      - Text/message of the tweet (quoted exactly)
      - Photo, if included
      - Link to another page, if included (and a copy of link)
  - Facebook pages of SMC and SCC police departments
      - Account name
      - Time of status update/post
      - Category of status update/post (original, share, etc.)
      - Number of likes
      - Number of comments (and content?)
      - Text/message of the update/post (quoted exactly)
      - Photo, if included
      - Link to another page, if included (and a copy of that link)
  - YouTube/Vimeo channels of SMC and SCC police departments
      - Account name
      - Time of uploaded video
      - Number of thumbs up, or “rating”
      - Length of video
      - Number of comments

A KEY NOTE: If somehow possible, I want to track users of each of these media and see if/how they overlap. I will have to look into the types of programs that can make this clear for me, as I am not sure I want to do that all by hand (ugh).

Also, I need to get my hands on some internal records from police departments in the area, based on my searches from the above data sources, to get a sense of which cases received help/tips from social media. A lot of this information, I believe, comes through a technology called “Nixel.” (I need to get to the bottom of this… more to come.)

#### STORIES ON THE SUBJECT:
A lot of the stories I’ve read on the issue are focused on who to “appropriately tweet,” or explain which social media platforms are the most useful by occasion, tone, message, and audience. I found a couple from news outlets, as well as some guidelines from police agencies themselves. They are listed below.
