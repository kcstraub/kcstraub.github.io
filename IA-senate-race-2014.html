<h1> Where'd the money come from? (PART I)</h1>
<h4> In the the 2013-2014 Iowa Senate race, candidates Bruce Braley (D) and Joni Ernst (R) received itemized individual contributions to 
their campaigns from both in- and out-of-state donors. 
<p> Below are the percentage breakdowns outlining how many of their contributors (who made individual itemized contributions) were in-state versus out-of-state.

<p> So, it looks like Braley had WAY more contributions, yes? Well, not really. He had more individual contributors, but they each gave an average of 
a over a hundred dollars. With Ernst's campaign, that's not the case:
