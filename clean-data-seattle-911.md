I found a giant data set of all [the real-time 911 calls made to the Seattle Fire Departent since 2010.](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Seattle-Real-Time-Fire-911-Calls/kzjm-xkqj) After running that data through Data Refine (though I used the earlier version, "Google Refine"), it because immediately clear that could clean the data based on the "type" of call, or as I call it, the "classification." I discovered I could fuss around with the different clutering algorithms available to eliminate spelling errors, rogue punctuation, and fairly repetitive classifications within the data for the 911 calls. 

In order to yield a readable visualization out of thousands of data points, though, I needed to narrow down the classifications to the smallest number I could reasonably allow. I this was easy to do at first... for example, I lumped together all "fire" incidents, regardless of the size of the fire team sent or the location of the fire within a house. But from there, I found myself having to make some further decisions: what if a fire or accident occured on a boat, aircraft or train? Or what if the fire call was the result of an automated alarm? I went ahead and deemed individual classifications for all those that seemed too different from the others to lump together. I realize that probably simplifies this data tremendously (for example, you don't get to know that lumped inside "medic response" is "antiboitic delivery," or that inside "electrical problems" is "downed wires." 

I figured I did for this data set what the FEC did for contributor employers (or rather, the industry in which their employer sits). For the sake of understanding the general overview of what's happening, I sacrificed the details. 

One major issue though, that I can't get over in the same way I could the mere "simplification." I worry that a lot of these categories overlap. There were a few times when this particular data set had a call listed as one classification, with an all-but-empty row beneath it that also listed a different classification -- a kind of "sub-classification." Thus, within an aid response call, there could also be a fire call (for example). As this is my first time playing with Data Refine, I wasn't exactly sure how to cluster things together to override this subcategory problem, and I am a little fuzzy on how many may have overlapped. I tried to ensure that when I clustered, I clustered only once, but I want to practice more with the software to double check.
